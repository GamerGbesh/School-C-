Here’s a list of practical and theoretical C++ questions for each of the listed topics: 

---

### **1. Vectors** 
**Practical**:  
1. Write a program to input 10 integers into a vector and find the sum of all the even numbers.
2. Create a program to sort a vector of integers in ascending order without using the `sort()` function.  
3. Write a program to remove all duplicate elements from a vector.  
4. Write a program to reverse a vector in place without using additional memory.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. Explain the difference between vectors and arrays in C++.  
2. How does a vector dynamically manage its size in memory?

### **2. Arrays** 
**Practical**:  
1. Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in an array of integers.  
2. Create a program to rotate an array by `n` positions to the right.  
3. Implement a program to check if an array is a palindrome.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What are the differences between single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays?  
2. How is memory allocated for arrays in C++?  

---

### **3. Struct** 
**Practical**:  
1. Define a struct `Student` with fields `name`, `age`, and `marks`. Write a program to input data for 5 students and display the details of the student with the highest marks.  
2. Write a program to define a struct `Rectangle` with fields `length` and `width`. Add a function to calculate and display the area of the rectangle.  
3. Implement a program to store and sort employee details (ID, name, salary) using a struct.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What is the purpose of a `struct` in C++? How is it different from a class?  
2. Can a struct contain member functions? Explain with an example.  

---

### **4. Void Functions** 
**Practical**:  
1. Write a void function to swap two integers without using a temporary variable.  
2. Create a void function to calculate and print the factorial of a number.  
3. Implement a program where a void function accepts an array and modifies its elements by doubling them.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. Why can’t a void function return a value?  
2. How do you pass parameters by reference in a void function?  

---

### **5. Value-Returning Functions** 
**Practical**:  
1. Write a function that takes two integers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).  
2. Implement a program with a function that takes a string and returns whether it is a palindrome.  
3. Create a program with a function to find the nth Fibonacci number.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What is the difference between a value-returning function and a void function?  
2. Explain the role of the return statement in value-returning functions.  

---

### **6. Enum**  
**Practical**:  
1. Define an enum for days of the week. Write a program to print the name of the day based on the integer input (e.g., 1 = Monday).  
2. Create an enum for traffic light colors (RED, GREEN, YELLOW). Write a program to simulate a traffic light system.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What is an enum, and how is it different from `#define` constants?  
2. Can you assign specific values to enums? Provide an example.  

---

### **7. Data Types** 
**Practical**:  
1. Write a program to display the size of all basic data types (int, float, char, etc.) in C++.  
2. Implement a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa using appropriate data types.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What is the difference between signed and unsigned integers?  
2. Explain the difference between float, double, and long double.  

---

### **8. Loops**  
**Practical**:  
1. Write a program using a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of a number.  
2. Create a program that uses a `while` loop to find the sum of digits of an integer.  
3. Write a program to display the first 10 prime numbers using nested loops.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. What are the differences between `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in C++?  
2. Explain the concept of an infinite loop with examples.  

---

### **9. Conditional Statements**  
**Practical**:  
1. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year using an `if-else` statement.  
2. Create a program using a `switch` statement to display the corresponding grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on a numerical score.  
3. Write a program to classify a given number as positive, negative, or zero using nested conditional statements.  

**Theoretical**:  
1. Explain the syntax and use cases of a `switch` statement.  
2. How is the `else-if` ladder different from a series of `if` statements?
